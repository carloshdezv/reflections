How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can identify what change in both files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If something goes wrong, you can roll back to the last correct version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    git

    you have the control when to commit a change, however if too much commits are made, history could not be useful

    google docs

    changes are saved often so if something wrong happens, you can rollback to lastest saved version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because for coding purposes, there are relationship between files, thats why git commits multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all changes and commits on files, and git diff show you deletions and insertions on between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control is ga good tool to make new changes without worry about make mistakes on code, because you can roll back to the previous correct version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Update R or python code
